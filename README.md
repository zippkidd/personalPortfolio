# My Personal Portfolio
A digital portfolio I created for myself using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Font Awesome 5 icons. jQuery was used for smooth scrolling scroll up/down buttons. Stacked the Bootstrap grid in combination with CSS3 transitions to reveal descriptions of the project when hovering over screenshot. Simple parallax background and Tajawal Google Font family.
